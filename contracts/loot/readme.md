# Loot Arcade

This is a fork of the OG Loot physics to show how a minigame can be played.

This is experimental.

#### TODO High priority:
- ADD Statistics Points
-- At XP level - spend points onto a Stat level
-- Health Shop - Bid style


#### TODO Low priority:
- Multipler damage for adventurer Level. The Adventurer should both, deal more damange and receive more damage. 

### Objective

Get the highest gold balance without dying.... Do you dare? You can always stop on top


### How to play

First mint an Adventurer

```
nile mint_adventurer_with_item
```

You now have an adventurer - see them with:

```
nile get_adventurer 7

You can do three things, choose wisely

### Explore

This is like searching the long grass in pokemon... You might discover a Beast... You might discover gold... You might discover a trap

Once you have discovered - you can flee or fight. If you flee you might get hurt.

```
nile explore

ðŸ¤” You discovered nothing

try again....
```

### Fight



### Buy items


- Loot items are not tradable
- They spawn on market every 8hrs, and you can purchase.
