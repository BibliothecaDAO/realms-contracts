You can do three things, choose wisely

### Explore

This is like searching the long grass in pokemon... You might discover a Beast... You might discover gold... You might discover a trap

Once you have discovered - you can flee or fight. If you flee you might get hurt.

```
nile explore

ðŸ¤” You discovered nothing

try again....
```

### Fight



### Buy

There is a native dynamic loot market. However there are some rules.

- Items are not tradable from an Adventurer. They are soul bound to that Character.
- Items can be rerolled every 6hrs by anyone. It is an open function and the Adventurer who rolls it gets 3 gold.
- When rerolled the past Items that have not been purchased are no longer purchasable.
- You must bid on an Item above the minimum bid, currently (3)
- You must claim your item after you have won the bid
